      <h2 class="question">Why am I a Chistian?</h2>
      <p>Honestly, for my entire life I grew up with God's word being surrounded with me. I was taken to church, I've been in a Christian school since Kindergarten (6 years old), and growing up in his word I learnt about the law that says "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23) and that sounded really intimidating to me until I learnt that God loves the world so much so that he sent his only son to take not just my place for my sins but the sins of the ENTIRE human race (John 3:16, Jeremiah 31:3, and countless prophies about Jesus) and it's not just that God tells us that he will always be with us (Isaiah 41:10) that he will strengthen us (Isaiah 41:10, Philippians 4:13, Isaiah 40:29–31). (Also, there is so many verses that talk about how much God loves us and has a plan for us and so much more!)

Above is initially what I wanted to tell you but that's not why I believe... the real reason I believe in God because I heard the word and the Holy Spirt worked faith in my heart and brought me to God (1 Corinthians 12:3, Romans 10:17) and I hope to be someone who can plant seeds in other people's hearts that the Holy Spirt works faith into and brings them into God's family.</p>
      <h2 class="question">Is God good?</h2>
      <p>Yes, God is good. There is plenty of verses in the Holy Bible about God being good but here are a few I love:
"Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever!" - 1 Chronicles 16:34
"Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever." - Psalm 23:6
"Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions; according to your steadfast love remember me, for the sake of your goodness, O Lord!" - Psalm 25:7
"For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving, abounding in steadfast love to all who call upon you." - Psalm 86:5
And if you look at these verses they don't just show he is "good" they show that he is loving and his love is unbreakable, that he is merciful (he sent his son to DIE for us to save the entire human race though faith and salvation alone), that he will be with us wherever we are, that he is forgiving, and doesn't hold our sin against us if we repent of our sins!

I want to tell you something else to, God isn't just "good". He isn't just a "good person". He is the embodiment of perfect and the Holy Bible even tells us this too here are some of my favorites!
"You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect." - Matthew 5:48 
"This God—his way is perfect; the word of the Lord proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him." - 2 Samuel 22:31, Psalm 18:30 (yeah the SAME verse)
"The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple;" - Psalm 19:7
Look at these verses too! Not only do they say God is perfect they tell us that his law is perfect and again reminds us of his love by being a shield for us!</p>
