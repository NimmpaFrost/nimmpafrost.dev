Greatings and welcome to my repo page about my very own custom website!
Currently my website was made by Carrd.co (main and /meow) where I took the HTML and made it onto here.

I'm learning both HTML and CSS so I can make my own websites without having to take code from an editor and enchance my future.

I ask if you do take the HTML that you remake it in your own way as to not copy me, what i mean by that is don't just copy everything images included, make your own spin on it (from the HTML made by Carrd).
I do request that any HTML made by me is not taken without permission, this would include anything in /test and i hope to move it to my main website and /meow.

Thank you and have a lovely day <3
